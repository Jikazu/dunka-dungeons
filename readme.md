# DUNKA DUNGEONS

# The purpose with this project

The purpose of my project is to have a hub outside of Discord for my World of Warcraft guild, to show potential new recruits what we're about, and where they can apply to join the guild. The site contains three pages with a home site, gallery and an application windoww. Application is done via a form.

The target audience are World of Warcraft players on Firemaw with an interest of joining our guild.

This website is the first of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the project can be found here -

# UX

### Site Purpose:
* This site is meant for anyone that plays World of Warcraft on the Firemaw server that is interested in knowing more about our guild, or have interest in joining the guild.
* It can also be used by our current members to check our current recruitment status or when the next meetup is.
 
### Site Goal:
* Is to inform anyone interested in our guild, what we are about, what they can expect when joining our guild and what we're currently recruiting.

### Audience:
* Anyone currently playing on Firemaw looking for a guild, or anyone interested in transferring to our server and join our guild.

### User goals:
* Find information about the guild
* See when the next irl meetup is
* Be able to apply to the guild
* See the recruitment status

### Requirements
A responsive website that incorporates the languages I have learned so far, with a development process that needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub.

Required technologies: HTML, CSS


### Design
This is my first ever coding project, thus I've been quite inspired by the "Love Running" project I did earlier in the course. My design of the header and the footer have been inspired by that project. 

### Colour
The colour palette is created with regards to my hero image to get the colours unified. The hero image is the endpboss for the expansion we're currently playing so it fits well with the theme, as we are a raidingguild. I created it using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/sv/create/color-wheel)

### Typography

The google font [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin?query=cabin) was used for this project with a fallback of Sans-Serif. I've used font weight 600.  

### Images

I've borrowed one picture from the World of Wacraft website of the Lich King that I'm using as a hero image. All the photos in the gallery are either screenshots taken by me, or pictures taken by various guildmembers from several of our in real life meetups.
