# The purpose with this project

The purpose of my project is to have a hub outside of Discord for my World of Warcraft guild, to show potential new recruits what we're about, and where they can apply to join the guild. The site contains three pages with a home site, gallery and an application windoww. Application is done via a form.

The target audience are World of Warcraft players on Firemaw with an interest of joining our guild.

This website is the first of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.
