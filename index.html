            <h3>How it started</h3>
            <p>
                Dunka Dungeons was started on the 21st of February 2020.
                We created this guild because we were tired of not finding dungeon groups,
                when most of the people were busy buying dungeon boosts. During our journey we found likeminded
                people, and within weeks we had our core group.
            </p>

                <h3>Where are we now?</h3>
                <p>
                    We are an international semi-casual raiding guild, with people from all over Europe. We raid on Sundays at 19-23 and Mondays 20-23.
                    We use EPGP with a weekly 10% decay. We're a relaxed, fun-centric guild that has wide variety of members with different playing times/habits/styles. 
                    Raiding with us is always a laugh and even if things don't go to plan we don't get hung up on it.
